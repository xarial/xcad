Dimensions is an additional source of input for macro feature. Dimensions can be defined in the following way:

<<< @/_src/CustomFeature/DimensionsParameters.cs

It is required to arrange the dimensions within rebuild by specifying the *alignDim* delegate. Use **IXCustomFeatureDefinition`<TParams>`.AlignDimension** and extension helper methods to align the dimension.

<<< @/_src/CustomFeature/SetDimensions.cs

*Origin* is a starting point of the dimension.

For linear dimensions *orientation* represents the vector along the direction of the dimension (i.e. the direction of measured entity)
For radial dimensions *orientation* represents the normal of the dimension (i.e. the vector of rotation of the dimension)
