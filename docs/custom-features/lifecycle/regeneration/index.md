This handler called when feature is being rebuilt (either when regenerate is invoked or when the parent elements have been changed).

Use **CustomFeatureRebuildResult** class to generate the required output.

Feature can generate the following output

<<< @/_src/CustomFeature/RegenerationResults.cs

Use **IXGeometryBuilder** interface if feature needs to create new bodies. Only temp bodies can be returned from the regeneration method.
