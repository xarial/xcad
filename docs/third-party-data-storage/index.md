xCAD framework provides functionality for handling the data (both serializing and deserializing) in SOLIDWORKS 3rd party [storage (stream)](./stream/index) and [storage store](./storage/index).

Refer [Data saving in the 3rd party storage using SOLIDWORKS API](https://www.codestack.net/solidworks-api/data-storage/third-party/) for detailed overview of 3rd party storage and store.

It is recommended to use this functionality in conjunction with [Documents Management](/documents-management/).

Refer [Issues Manager](https://github.com/xarial/xcad-examples/tree/master/IssuesManager) example for demonstration of how custom storage can be used to store and manage the file specific issues list in SOLIDWORKS.
