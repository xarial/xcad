![Custom Model View Manager Tab](model-view-manager.png){ width=600 }

xCAD framework allows to add custom [Windows Forms controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.usercontrol) and [WPF controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.controls.usercontrol) into Model View Manager tabs.

This functionality is only available for Part and Assembly documents

Decorate the control classes with **TitleAttribute** to assign a tab name.
